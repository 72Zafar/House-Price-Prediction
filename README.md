House Price Prediction
This notebook aims to predict house prices using various features from a real estate dataset. The objective is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates house prices based on a set of input features like area, number of bedrooms, location, and condition.

Key Components of the Notebook:
1 Data Loading and Preprocessing:
The dataset is loaded, and necessary preprocessing steps are applied to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the distribution of the data, correlations between features, and outliers that might affect model performance.

2 Feature Engineering:
New features are created based on the existing dataset, such as price per square foot or age of the property. Feature selection techniques are applied to choose the most relevant variables for prediction.

3 Modeling:
Several machine learning models are implemented, including: Linear Regression: As a baseline model to understand linear relationships between features and price. Random Forest: A more complex model that captures non-linear relationships and feature interactions. Gradient Boosting: A powerful ensemble method that iteratively improves the model by focusing on the errors of previous models. The models are evaluated using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

4 Model Evaluation:
Cross-validation is performed to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Feature importance analysis is conducted to determine which features contribute most to the prediction of house prices.

5 Hyperparameter Tuning:

Hyperparameters for models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are tuned using techniques like GridSearchCV to improve performance.

6 Final Predictions and Conclusion:
The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics. Predictions are made on the test dataset, and the results are analyzed to determine the modelâ€™s success in predicting house prices.

Key Findings:
Features such as the location of the property, the number of bedrooms, and the overall condition have a significant impact on house prices. Advanced models like Gradient Boosting provided better accuracy in prediction compared to simpler models like Linear Regression.

Future Improvements:
Incorporating more diverse features, such as neighborhood amenities or proximity to public transportation, could further improve model performance. Additional data cleaning and outlier removal could enhance the robustness of the model.
